## Cosmic Combos ##

In Cosmic Combos, the player attempts to save Earth from approaching asteroids. The only way to destroy the asteroids is to draw the patterns displayed below them. Asteroids will approach in waves, wherein in each of the three stages of the game, the patterns drawn under the asteroids get progressively more difficult and longer. The player will gain more points towards their overall score if they successfully combo multiple asteroids by lining up the drawn patterns. The player will lose a heart if an asteroid gets too close to Earth. However, if you lose three hearts, you lose. But donâ€™t worry, there is a special asteroid that gives back a heart. Furthermore, to make the game more difficult, you can increase the difficulty on the start screen to make the asteroids move faster and spawn more frequently.
